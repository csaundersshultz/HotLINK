## Overview
HotLINK is a deep learning model built in tensorflow, trained to detect volcanic thermal hotspots in VIIRS infrared imagery. A manuscript describing HotLINK in detail is still in review. 

To install HotLINK in your python environment, run  
`pip install git+https://github.com/csaundersshultz/HotLINK.git@v1.1`

The tutorial file found here (HotLINK_tutorial.ipynb) can be opened in google colab to run without the need for any local installation, and to see usage of most of the functions supplied here.
